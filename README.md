###Amazon-Clone 

Hope you are doing great !!
Currently I am learning ReactJS and tried my hands on making an amazon clone with it.

Have a Look at my clone <a href="https://clone-7b0cb.web.app/">HERE </a>

In this WebApp, I learned about 
-> Client side routing using "react-router-dom" 
-> "useContext" API to prevent props-drilling
-> Redirect without refreshing
-> Using Firebase as backend and Deployment using Firebase as well

Webapp mainly consists of three pages for now, viz
-> Login
-> Home
-> Checkout
