<h1>Amazon-Clone </h1>

Hope you are doing great !!
Currently I am learning ReactJS and tried my hands on making an amazon clone with it.

Have a Look at my clone <a target="_blank" href="https://clone-7b0cb.web.app/">HERE </a>

In this WebApp, I learned about 
<ul>
<li> Client side routing using "react-router-dom" </li>
<li> "useContext" API to prevent props-drilling</li>
<li> Redirect without refreshing</li>
<li> Using Firebase as backend and Deployment using Firebase as well</li>
</ul>

Webapp mainly consists of three pages for now, viz
<li> Login</li>
<li> Home</li>
<li> Checkout</li>
